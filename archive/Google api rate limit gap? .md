# Progress Update: Google Maps API Exponential Backoff Implementation

**Date:** 2025-05-05
**Status:** Implementation Complete & Unit Tested
**Target Audience:** AI Assistant / Backend Developer

## Objective Achieved:

Implemented exponential backoff retry mechanism in `GoogleMapsService` (`app/src/microservices/venue/services/google-maps.service.ts`) as outlined in `Google map API TDL.md`.

## Implementation Details:

- **Mechanism:** Utilized the `axios-retry` library.
- **Configuration:** `axios-retry` is configured directly within the `GoogleMapsService` constructor on the `axiosInstance` obtained from the injected `HttpService` (`httpService.axiosRef`).
  - Configuration includes `retries: 3`, exponential `retryDelay` with jitter, and a `retryCondition` targeting network errors, idempotent requests, status 429, and status >= 500.
- **Scope:** Refactored the following methods to use the retry-enabled `this.axiosInstance` for API calls:
  - `geocodeAddress`
  - `reverseGeocode`
  - `searchNearby`
  - `getPlaceDetails`
- `getPhotoUrl` remains unchanged as it does not perform an HTTP request.

## Testing Strategy & Rationale:

- **Unit Tests (`google-maps.service.spec.ts`):** Tests PASSING.
- **Mocking:**
  - `axios-retry` is mocked at the module level (`jest.mock('axios-retry')`).
  - `axiosInstance.get` is mocked using a simple `jest.fn()` provided via a mocked `HttpService`.
- **Verification Scope:**
  1.  **Retry Configuration:** Verified that `axios-retry` is called **once** during service instantiation with the correct `axiosInstance` and expected configuration options (retries, timeout reset).
  2.  **Core Service Logic:** Verified standard service flows (cache hits, rate limiting, single success handling, non-OK status handling, non-retryable error handling) using the mocked `axiosInstance.get` for single attempts.
- **Strategy Decision:** Explicitly **avoided** testing the *internal mechanics* of `axios-retry` (e.g., asserting specific call counts after mocked 429/503 errors, validating exact delays). Initial attempts proved this approach conflicts with standard mocking techniques (`jest.spyOn`, `axios-mock-adapter`) and leads to brittle tests. The current strategy confirms the retry mechanism is correctly *configured* and integrated, trusting the library functions as documented.

## Next Steps (as per TDL):

1.  Run linters/formatters.
2.  Stage and commit relevant changes (`google-maps.service.ts`, `google-maps.service.spec.ts`).
3.  Create Pull Request following project guidelines (`Cursor Rules/Universal /RULE 4 [GitHub Workflow Procedures].md`).
