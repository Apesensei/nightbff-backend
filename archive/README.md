# Archive – Deprecated & Legacy Configuration

This folder contains environment files, scripts and other configuration artefacts that are no longer part of the canonical NightBFF runtime path but are retained for historical reference.

* Keep files here **read-only** – they must never be sourced at runtime.
* Do **not** modify content except when fully removing artefacts in future clean-ups.
